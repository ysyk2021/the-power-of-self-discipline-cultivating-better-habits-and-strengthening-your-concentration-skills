Life is unpredictable, and unexpected changes can occur. It's important to be adaptable and flexible when facing change, and to adjust goals and plans accordingly. This can involve revisiting and modifying goals, prioritizing tasks, and seeking support when needed.

Seeking Support

Seeking support from friends, family, or a professional can provide encouragement and guidance. It's important to recognize when help is needed, and to reach out for support when facing challenges or experiencing burnout.
